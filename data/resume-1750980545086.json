I also prepare thoughtful questions to ask the interviewer, which shows my genuine interest and helps me understand if the company is the right fit for me. Additionally, I practice communicating my achievements and strengths clearly, so I can present myself confidently. This preparation helps me approach interviews with a positive mindset and ensures I make a strong impression."

Regarding salary expectations, based on my research about the industry standards and the responsibilities of this role, I would expect a fair and competitive compensation in line with what’s typical for someone with my educational background and skill set. I’m open to discussing the specific numbers further, once I have a better understanding of the full benefits package and growth opportunities within your company.\n\nAs for my strengths, I have a strong technical foundation due to my BTech from IIT Hyderabad, which has equipped me with solid analytical and problem-solving abilities. I’m also an excellent communicator, able to explain complex technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. I’m a fast learner, highly adaptable, and very comfortable working both independently and as part of a team.\n\nFor weaknesses, one area I’m actively working on is delegating tasks. As someone who takes ownership of projects, I sometimes tend to take on too much myself to ensure quality. However, I’ve recognized the importance of effective delegation for team success, and I’m making a conscious effort to trust my teammates and distribute responsibilities more efficiently."

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, casting refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. For example, you might want to convert a string that represents a number, like \"123\", into an integer so you can perform mathematical operations on it. \n\nPython provides built-in functions for casting, such as int(), float(), and str(). For instance, using int(\"123\") will convert the string \"123\" into the integer 123. Similarly, float(\"3.14\") will give you the floating-point number 3.14. Casting is especially useful when dealing with user input or data from external sources, which are often in string format and need to be converted for calculations or further processing.\n\nSo, in summary, casting allows us to change the type of data as needed so our program can work efficiently and handle different data types appropriately."
